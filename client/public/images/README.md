# Image Files for Hero Section

Please add the following images to this directory:

1. `main-bouquet.jpg` - Main large image of a woman holding a bouquet
2. `flower-arrangement.jpg` - Pink flower arrangement
3. `flower-arch.jpg` - Flower arch decoration
4. `small-bouquet.jpg` - Small bouquet design
5. `table-setting.jpg` - Table setting with flowers
6. `flower-wall.jpg` - Flower wall decoration

## Image Paths

The paths to use in your code are:
- `/images/main-bouquet.jpg`
- `/images/flower-arrangement.jpg`
- `/images/flower-arch.jpg`
- `/images/small-bouquet.jpg`
- `/images/table-setting.jpg`
- `/images/flower-wall.jpg`

These images are referenced in the HeroSection.tsx component using standard HTML img tags.

Note: In Next.js, the `/public` folder is the root for static assets, so in your code you reference the images without the `/public` part.
